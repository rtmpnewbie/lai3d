In here we have a modified version of the tolua++ 1.0.91 code generator with
added support for exception handling.

The lines that involve Lua 5.1 compatibility in 'tolua_scons.pkg' and 'lua/all.lua'
have been commented out as we supply Lua 5.01

The original tolua++ readme can be found at: '../tolua++/README'
if you need more details.
